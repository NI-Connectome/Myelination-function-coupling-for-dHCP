This folder contains the code required to calculate the growth effect of MFC, and the calculation results.

Specifically,

The program 'Growth_effect_analysis.R' uses the GAM model to capture the linear and nonlinear relationship between MFC and PMA, and the growth rate measured as averaged first derivative of the age smoothing term. 

The subfolder 'result' includes the growth rate measures as averaged first derivativecal (derivs_MFC.csv, derivs_gMFC.csv and derivs_sMFC.csv), and GAM model fitting effect measuread as p-value (Pvalue_MFC.csv, Pvalue_gMFC.csv and Pvalue_sMFC.csv).
